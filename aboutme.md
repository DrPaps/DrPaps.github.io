title: About me
---

My name is Pavan Pavithran. I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast with a background in Engineering Physics from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, currently invested deeply into all things cybersecurity.

This website serves as a portfolio and a learning journal, where I share my CTF writeups, vulnerability assessments, and technical insights. It is meant to reflect my growth and commitment to my learning in this field.

Iâ€™m open to opportunities across the cybersecurity field to broaden my horizons and am eager to contribute, collaborate, and grow within the community. Feel free to explore my work and get in touch.
